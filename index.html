      <h2>sherlock holmes</h2>
      <p><span class="firstcharacter">"O</span>h, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an
        absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends
        would be invited, and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken
        by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding
        had taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are
        all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."</p>

      <p>"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.</p>

      <p>"The vanishing of the lady."</p>

      <p>"When did she vanish, then?"</p>

      <p>"At the wedding breakfast."</p>

      <p>"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."</p>

      <p>"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."</p>

      <p>"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind
        anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me have the details."</p>

      <p>"I warn you that they are very incomplete."</p>

      <p>"Perhaps we may make them less so."</p>

      <p>"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to
        you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':</p>

      <p>"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and
        painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly announced in
        the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to
        confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of the attempts of the
        friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be
        served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.</p>

      <p>"'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present
        save the father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady
        Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party
        proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared.
        It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured
        to force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It
        was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman. The bride, who
        had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,
        when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some
        comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an
        instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the footmen declared that he
        had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing
        her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in
        conjunction with the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the police, and very energetic
        inquiries are being made, which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business. Up
        to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There are
        rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had
        caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may have been
        concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride.'"</p>

      <p>"And is that all?"</p>

      <p>"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."</p>

      <p>"And it is--"</p>

        <h2>Advanced Hover Effect with pure css</h2>
      <p>The most common function of hover effects is to highlight text links or buttons. But they have more functions.

          Hover effects add an element of interactivity to a website. They have powerful effects when applied to the images. They can also have a great impact on the user thus making your website well-designed.
          
          Hover is an effect that occurs while you place the mouse cursor over an object. It is mostly used for styling and usability.
          
          In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to create creative hover effects to your image using only CSS.</p>  
      
      <p>1. Create HTML
          Add figure tag with a class "image". The figure tag is used for indicating self-contained content.
          Use the fig.caption tag to include a caption or explanation to the content of the figure tag.</p>
        </article>
        <p>2. Add CSS
            Set the max-width, min-width and max-height of the image.
            Set the position to relative, so as the element is relative from its normal position.
            Set the overflow to hidden, so as the content be clipped to fit the padding box.
            Set the color of figcaption and the alignment of the text.</p>

            <p>Our next step is to add style to the h3.

                Set the background and the position of the h3.
                Specify the transform property. It defines the 2D or 3D transformation of the element. It allows to rotate, scale, skew or translate the element.
                Set the text-transform to uppercase, so as to make all characters of each word uppercase.
                Define the font-weight. Here, we set it to 400.</p>
                <p>Now let’s set a style to :before pseudo-element which is a generated content element that adds any element before the content.

                    Set the height and width of the element and define the color.
                    Specify the transition setting the transition-duration to 0.3.
